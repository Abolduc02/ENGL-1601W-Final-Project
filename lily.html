    <h2>Lily Bart on Herself</h2>
    <p>I belive that I have a very complicated relationship with myself. On the one hand, I think I am a beautiful and intelligent woman who is admired by many of my friends and other people in that live in the New York high life society. I believe am well-educated and have a sharp wit, and I often use my charm and intelligence to my advantage in social situations. I am proud of my appearance and my accomplishments, and I know that I have many qualities that are desirable in a woman of my time and social class.</p>
    <p>However, I am also plagued by self-doubt and insecurity. I am constantly worried about my place in society and my future prospects, and I often feel inadequate and unworthy compared to the other women around me. This insecurity is largely driven by my financial situation, as I am not as wealthy as many of my peers and am always at risk of losing my social standing. I worry that I will never be able to marry a wealthy man and secure my future, and this fear often consumes me. I am deeply in love with Selden, that's what my heart tells me, but my mind tells me I need to marry someone like Rosedale or Percy Gryce, a man with money that can support my lifestyle.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I am deeply conflicted about the role that I am expected to play as a woman in society. I want to be independent and to make my own choices, but I am also aware of the strict social norms that dictate how a woman should behave. I am expected to be demure and obedient, to marry well and to bear children, and to put the needs of my husband and family above my own. But these expectations conflict with my own desires and aspirations, and I often feel torn between my own wishes and the expectations of society.</p>
    <p>My thoughts about myself are complex and often contradictory. I am proud of my intelligence and charm, but I am also deeply insecure about my social and financial standing. I want to be independent, but I am also constrained by the expectations of society. I am constantly struggling to find a balance between my own desires and the demands of the world around me, and this struggle takes a heavy toll on me throughout the events that I have gone through. I have become very tired, but at the same time I cannot sleep at night. I wish I could just fall asleep forever...</p>
