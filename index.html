    <h2>Aaron Bolduc - Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>My final project is meant to be a small portfolio of the thoughts and feelings that Lily Bart has towards other characters of the novel, “The House of Mirth.” Throughout this novel, and other readings that we have studied in class, I noticed that none of the readings that we used to study the theme of women as prisoners of society were never from the perspective of the women themselves, they were either from an outside perspective or a perspective of a man. Even if the perspective of narration was from outside the scope of the characters, these books were still often written by men!</p>
    <p>In the novel, Lily Bart is often thinking about what other people think of her, and there aren’t too many moments were she reflects on how she feels about others, so I thought it would be interesting to creatively narrate how she feels of others, especially because of the position that she is in where she is a woman that has traits of beauty in which society expects her to become an object to a man and marry in order to benefit from his money and status. Lily in stuck in a limbo in which she knows society wants her to marry, even though she may not be truly in love with who she marries. She wants to be independent and make her own choices, and it is interesting to see how someone who is expected to fit this mold thinks. It is neat to see her actively thinking of ways to escape her stereotype and see her true feelings that she must mask because of what is expected of her.</p>
    <p>I wanted to analyze Lily’s thoughts to see how she felt about her friends and why they like to keep her around. It seems that throughout the novel she never realizes that her rich friends may be keeping her around because of how beautiful she is. In a way, it seems that her friends are objectifying her beauty by always wanting to pay for her things, so she stays around. While Lily may be stuck in a “prison” that society entraps her in, it seems that she is aware of it and is actively struggling to fit into this expectation while also fulfilling her own desires at the same time.</p>
    <p>I decided to make my final project a portfolio-styled website because I wanted to demonstrate the type of art that I enjoy creating. It may not relate to the themes of the course in anyway, but I wanted to demonstrate the enjoyment that I have in designing and creating websites for other people to view and use.</p>
