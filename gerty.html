    <h2>Lily Bart on Gerty Farish</h2>
    <p>As my relationship with Gerty progresses, I become increasingly conflicted about my feelings for Gerty Farish. On the one hand, I am grateful for her friendship and support, and I value the honesty and kindness that she brings to our relationship. She is one of the few people in my life who truly cares about my wellbeing, and she is always ready to offer me support and guidance.</p>
    <p>Gerty is a kind and compassionate person, and she is always ready to listen to my troubles and offer me advice. She is one of the few people in my life who truly understands me, and she is not afraid to speak her mind, even when it goes against the conventions of society. I appreciate her honesty and her willingness to challenge me and the norms of society.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I am also somewhat dismissive of Gerty and her lack of social standing and wealth. I am often careless and thoughtless in my interactions with her, and I sometimes take her for granted. I am sometimes embarrassed by her lack of social graces and her lack of wealth, and I worry that being associated with her could damage my reputation. Despite this, Gerty remains a steadfast friend to me, and she is always ready to offer me her support and guidance. She is willing to sacrifice her own happiness to help me, and she remains loyal and devoted to me throughout the novel.</p>
    <p>As I navigate the treacherous waters of New York society, Gerty becomes a constant source of support and guidance for me. She is always there for me, offering me her friendship and her wisdom, and she never judges me for my mistakes or my flaws. Despite my occasional dismissiveness and thoughtlessness, Gerty remains a loyal and devoted friend to me, and I am grateful for her presence in my life.</p>
    <p>Overall, my feelings for Gerty are a mixture of gratitude, affection, and occasional irritation. I am grateful for her friendship and support, but I am also sometimes dismissive of her and her lack of social standing. Despite this, Gerty remains a loyal and devoted friend to me throughout the novel. She is a constant source of support and guidance, and I am happy that I always have someone to go to for support if I need it. She is often my escape from the harsh reality of trying to fit in with the New York high life.</p>
