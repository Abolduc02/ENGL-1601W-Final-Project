    <h2>Lily Bart on Bertha Dorset</h2>
    <p>As my social situation and relationship with Bertha unfolds, I become increasingly conflicted about my feelings for Bertha Dorset. On the one hand, I am envious of her wealth and social standing, and I am drawn to her because of her glamour and her ability to manipulate and control the people around her. I am captivated by her beauty and her charm, and I am often swayed by her manipulations and her scheming. I see her as a manipulative and cunning woman who is more interested in furthering her own social standing and gaining power over others than in genuine friendship or happiness.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I am also wary of Bertha and her scheming and ruthless nature. I am afraid of being caught in her web of deceit, and I am afraid of the damage that her manipulations could cause to my reputation and my standing in society. She tried to destroy my life after the trip to Europe, and I had to hold back from ruining hers with the letters that I had against her. Despite my reservations, I am drawn to Bertha and the power and influence she wields in New York society, and I am often swayed by her manipulations, even though I know they are dangerous and potentially damaging.</p>
    <p>As I navigate the treacherous waters of New York society, Bertha becomes a constant presence in my life. She is always scheming and manipulating, and she is always seeking to control and dominate the people around her. I am drawn to her glamour and her ability to control the people around her, even though I know that she is manipulative and ruthless.</p>
    <p>I am also aware of Bertha's hypocrisy and shallow nature. Despite her wealth and social status, she is not well-liked by many of my other friends that I have made along the way, who see through her facade and recognize her as a selfish and ruthless person. This is a stark contrast to the way I try to live my life, which is to be kind and considerate to others, and to always strive for personal integrity and authenticity.</p>
    <p>I regard Bertha Dorset as a dangerous and treacherous woman who is not to be trusted. I am wary of her and avoid her whenever possible, knowing that she will stop at nothing to get what she wants, even if it means hurting those around her. I find her behavior reprehensible and cannot understand how someone could be so lacking in empathy and compassion.</p>
