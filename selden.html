    <h2>Lily Bart on Lawrence Seldon</h2>
    <p>As time goes on, I become increasingly conflicted about my feelings for Lawrence Selden. On the one hand, I am drawn to him because he is intelligent and perceptive, and I enjoy his company. We have many engaging conversations, and I find myself looking forward to spending time with him. However, I am also wary of him because he is a bit of an outsider in New York society, and I am afraid that being associated with him could damage my reputation.</p>
    <p>Despite my reservations, I often find myself seeking out Selden's company, and I enjoy the conversations we have. He is one of the few people in my social circle who truly understands me, and he is not afraid to speak his mind, even when it goes against the conventions of society. I appreciate his honesty and his willingness to challenge me and the norms of society.</p>
    <p>Despite my feelings for Selden, I ultimately struggle to fully commit to a relationship with him. I am afraid of giving up the security and comfort of my position in society, and I am not sure if I am ready to take the risks that a relationship with Selden would require. I am torn between my desire for a meaningful connection with him and my fear of losing my social standing and the comforts that come with it.</p>
    <p>In the end, my fear and indecision leads to my downfall. I am unable to fully commit to a relationship with Selden, and I am unable to find happiness and fulfillment within the constraints of New York society. My inability to make a choice and take a risk ultimately leads to my downfall.</p>
    <p>From my perspective, my feelings for Selden are a source of both attraction and conflict. I am drawn to him because he is one of the few people who truly understands me, but I am afraid of the risks that a relationship with him would entail. In the end, my inability to fully commit to a relationship with Selden ultimately leads to my downfall. I am unable to find happiness and fulfillment within the constraints of New York society, and my fear and indecision lead me to spiral into a pit of uncertainty and despair.</p>
